					Over the recent years, Portland, OR has seen a massive boom in Bike-Share Systems (BSS) and E-scooter sharing systems (ESS) programs.
					These programs allow for rentable scooters and bikes to be accessible all around portland, creating an easily accessible, small-scale transportation system.
					Compared to the Transit program, BSS and ESS are not stuck to a schedule or a specific route, meaning users can go to and from locations directly, rather than a roundabout route to a roughly close location.
					They also provide a speedy and fun alternative to walking around the vast city.
					BSS and ESS do have a potential downside, however.
					Both systems are rather expensive to rent, deterring some people from using them simply due to cost.
					This alone would not be an issue, however the abundance of bikes and scooters that are not being used raises a question: Are these vehicles going to end up being Electronic Waste?
