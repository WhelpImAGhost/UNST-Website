					In conclusion, this data will either help a company realise how much their product is beneficial to the planet and to the people of Portland, or it will bring to light the wasteful products being created.
					Funding for this research will heavily incentivize more people to participate in this survey and research, meaning more data will be collected and utilized. 
					This information can also be more beneficial to the City of Portland as well, as a larger number of participants using BSS and ESS can help the city incentivize more bike paths and safer bike trails.
					Overall, this research will help out the city and pupulation, even the planet, in many ways by helping gather more information on the BSS and ESS programs and their usage.
