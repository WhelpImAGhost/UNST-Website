				<p class="columnsplit2">The reasoniing behind doing this research is to prevent mass quantities of electronics from ending up in the landfill, and lots of resources from being used up without reason.
					Our current society wastes a significant out of electrical devices, between phones and tablets, devices with partially broken parts, or overproduction of products that did not sell.
					All of these situations end up with more devices in the landfill, or as waste.
					Since there has been a massive spike in the production of these bikes and scooters for Portland and other cities, it is imperative that they are used, otherwise they stand no more use than paperweights.
					Limiting the generation of waste and E-waste should be a high priority in this society, but it is not, so we must take steps to verify the production and usage of products. 
					Companies should not be allowed to generate "wasteful" products with no value or usage.
					<br>
					If this research is conducted, we can either confirm that these scooters and bikes are worth their large production and maintenance costs, or we can work towards eliminating some of those costs.
