					To investigate the current state and usage of the BSS/ESS programs, a wide-scale survey will be created to survey the population of Portland.
					Initially, a small questionnaire will be sampled out to ~20-30 people, then the information gathered from those surveys will be used to create a larger questionnaire that will be available for Portland pedestrians and residents.
					These questions will involve some personal information, such as a person's age and whether or not they have a car, whether they use the BSS/ESS systems, their opinions on the systems, etc.
					More questions will be focused around the actual systems, and the person's ideas and general usage (or lack there of) of the systems, since that will be the main topic of the research.
					<br>
					<br>
					Ananlysis of this data will involve taking the number of people surveyed and comparing that to the number of people who use the scooters. 
					If more than 50% of the population within Portland who took the survey use the BSS/ESS programs, then it may be concluded that a sufficient number of people are using the programs and the vehicels are not doomed to be E-Waste.
					However, if less than 50% of the population use the programs, then it can be concluded that they are likely to end up being E-waste, or causing more harm to the world than a world without them.
