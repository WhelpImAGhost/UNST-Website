					Due to the newness of the BSS and ESS programs, not many studies have been done regarding them and their longevity or use. 
					Realistically, there is little information overall regarding them, other than what the program company gives to the public.
					This is why studies regarding their daily use and public opinions of the BSS and ESS programs need to take place.
					These studies will shine light towards whether these programs are more detrimental than they initially seem.
					<br>
					There have been a couple studies regarding a different version of BSS, known as docked BSS, but these are not the same system and have different pros and cons.<br>
					<br>

						&emsp;<em>“Much of the literature related to micromobility studies has focused on docked bikesharing, with comparatively little research on dockless BSS and even scarcer investigations into ESS systems.”</em> (Blaznin et al., 2021).

						<br>
						<br>

						Out of the research that has been done, most of it pays attention more to the unsafe practices that riders use while operating the BSS or ESS vehicles.
							
							<br><br>
								&emsp;<em>“This is particularly so because many users of ESS/BSS (66% of users according to the Portland Bureau of Transportation, 2018) are not aware of their obligations when sharing the road with other vehicles and pedestrians.”</em> (Blaznin et al., 2021)<br><br>
						With the lack of safety gear and road knowledge, BSS and ESS also pose a safety risk for users and passersby alike.<br>

						The final talking point is in regard to maintenance and transportation of the scooters and bikes.
						Since the BSS and ESS vehicles are primarily electric vehicles, they need to be charged after use.
						And since they are not docked vehicles, the only way to charge them is to either take the battery out of them and put a new one in, or to take the whole vehicle to be charged.
						Both options require some sort of large vehicle, like a car or van, to collect the 
							v.	Scooters are more of a pollutant than other means of transport, unless the scooter has a long use life (Hollingsworth et al., 2019)
						b.	Why these studies are insufficient / what else needs to be studied
							i.	Neither article cited above suggests that the BSS/ESS programs are worth their added carbon footprint or their cost
