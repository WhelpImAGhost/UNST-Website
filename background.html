					Our goal is to help strengthen our community by creating friendships with those around us and sharing information on how to get involved with climate change.
					Climate change is something that's affecting all of us and knowing how and where to get starting can make a big difference.
					If you are already knowledgeable in climate change you're still encouraged to look around!
					We're going to need all types backgrounds and knowledge to fight climate change.
					Please consider checking out the grassroots organizations linked.
